# Waiter-Tips-Predictor

This project focuses on analyzing tipping behavior in restaurants, utilizing a dataset that includes features like total bill, tip amount, gender, and more. The goal is to predict the tips given to waiters based on these factors.

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration:** Performed initial data cleaning, checking for null values, and generating descriptive statistics.
- **Visualization:** Created various plots to visualize tips in relation to total bill, number of people, day of the week, gender, and more.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Trained a Linear Regression model to predict tips based on the provided features after transforming categorical data into numerical format.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Results

- Successfully visualized the relationships between different features and tips.
- Built a predictive model that provides insights into tipping behavior.
